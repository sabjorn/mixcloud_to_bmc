# Mixcloud to Bandcamp Music Club
## About
javascript and python script to find the bandcamp link for each track in a bandcamp mix

## Usage
### Step 0
Install python requirements. Using `venv` is a good idea:

(optional)
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

then
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 1
Navigate to the Mixcloud page that contains the mix your are trying to export. This must be your mix and you must be logged in to see the tracklist.

Copy and paste the contents of `mixcloud_ripper.js` into the browser console and save the file in a known location.

### Step 2
In `terminal` run the command

```
filename=<the .txt generated by the JS script above>
while read line 
do
  echo $line
  python3 ./find_bandcamp_links.py $line >> links.txt
done <<< $(cat $filename) 
```

This will generate all the potential bandcamp links for that playlist.

### Step 3
Paste every link from the `links.txt` file generated from **step 2** into a Buy Music Club playlist.

## Future Developmement
There is no API for Buy Music Club but finding a way to generate playlists from the python script automatically is a top priority
